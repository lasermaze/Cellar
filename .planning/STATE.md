## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-planning: Wine via Gcenx tap (not bundled) — wine-stable deprecated Sep 2026
- Pre-planning: wined3d/OpenGL for DX8/DX9 — only viable path for old-game wedge
- Pre-planning: API-first AI — simpler than local inference for MVP
- Pre-planning: Cossacks: European Wars as flagship test game
- 2026-03-25: Roadmap restructured from horizontal layers to vertical functional slices — Phase 1 delivers the full pipeline for one game rather than foundation infrastructure only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Swift TUI ecosystem is weak — v1 is CLI-only (TUI deferred to v2), but raw ANSI may be needed for good UX
- Gcenx tap is a single-maintainer dependency — worth monitoring
- macOS OpenGL is deprecated — only DX8/DX9 path, could break in a future macOS version
